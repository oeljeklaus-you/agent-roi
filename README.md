## Why Agent ROI

Most AI coding tools can tell you:

- Tokens
- Cost

But they usually cannot answer:

- Which tasks were the most expensive?
- Which tasks were the most efficient?
- Which tasks may have wasted budget?
- What did the AI spend actually produce?

Agent ROI exists to answer those questions.

## Dashboard

Open a local dashboard when you want a faster visual pass over your recent tasks, project coverage, waste signals, and recommendations.

```bash
agent-roi ui --open
```

![Agent ROI dashboard overview](.github/assets/dashboard-overview.png)

What the dashboard currently gives you:

- `Overview`
  A visual summary of spend, coverage gaps, trend direction, waste signals, and the next recommendation.
- `Projects`
  A searchable, filterable view of tracked vs untracked projects, sessions, tokens, and latest activity.
- `Tasks`
  A searchable, filterable review queue for recent completed tasks, attribution status, and Git output.
- `Budget / Compare / Insights / Waste / Recommendations / Leaderboard`
  The same local analyses from the CLI, organized into dedicated pages.

## Example Output

Insights:

```text

```

Waste:

1. Refactor CSS
   Cost: $5.42
   Duration: 1h 32m

```text
Recommendations (Last 30 Days)

1. Break Large Tasks

Tasks under 45m produced 5.3x more commits per dollar than tasks over 2h.

Consider splitting large tasks into smaller units.

2 tasks consumed $5.91 with zero commits.
```

1. Fix purchase button
   Cost: $0.42
   LOC Per Dollar: 238 LOC/$1

Least Efficient Tasks

1. Refactor auth flow
   Cost: $8.32

Summary
- AI Cost: $12.41 → $9.32 (-25%)
- Tasks: 8 → 10 (+25%)
- Commits: 6 → 9 (+50%)
- Waste Cost: $4.20 → $1.10 (-74%)

Takeaway:
You spent less and produced more Git output.
```

Budget:

```text
Budget (This Month)

Scope
- Codex only
- Claude snapshots excluded

Spend
- $12.41 spent this month
- 12 Codex sessions
- 1.2M tokens

Projection
- $37.23 projected month-end spend
- $1.24/day over 10 of 30 days

Status
- Projected over budget by $7.23 on a $30.00 monthly budget.
```

## Quick Start

```bash
agent-roi scan

agent-roi watch

# work normally on Git branches
# switch branches when changing tasks
# press Ctrl+C to stop

agent-roi report

agent-roi insights

agent-roi waste

agent-roi recommend

agent-roi leaderboard

agent-roi compare

agent-roi budget --budget 30

agent-roi ui --open
```

What each step does:

- `scan`
  Import local AI usage.
- `watch`
  Auto-manage task attribution from Git branches in the foreground.
- `task`
  Start and stop tasks manually when watch mode is not the right fit.
- `report`
  Understand repository-level ROI.
- `insights`
  Discover patterns.
- `waste`
  Find potentially wasteful tasks.
- `recommend`
  Get actionable suggestions.
- `leaderboard`
  See your most expensive and most efficient tasks.
- `compare`
  Compare the last 7 days with the previous 7 days.
- `budget`
  Track current month Codex spend and projected month-end budget.
- `ui`
  Open the local dashboard for overview, projects, tasks, budget, waste, recommendations, and rankings.

## Commands

- `agent-roi scan`
  Import local AI usage into SQLite.
- `agent-roi task`
  Start, stop, and review attributed tasks.
- `agent-roi watch`
  Auto-start and auto-stop tasks by polling the current Git branch every 15 seconds.
- `agent-roi ui`
  Open the local dashboard. Use `--open` to launch it in your browser and `--budget <usd>` to show a budget target.
- `agent-roi report`
  Show repository-level ROI for the current Git repo.
- `agent-roi insights`
  Show lightweight task insights for the last 30 days.
- `agent-roi waste`
  Show potential waste candidates for the last 30 days.
- `agent-roi recommend`
  Turn recent task patterns into concrete suggestions.
- `agent-roi leaderboard`
  Rank recent tasks by cost and efficiency.
- `agent-roi compare`
  Compare the last 7 days with the previous 7 days.
- `agent-roi budget`
  Track current month Codex spend and projected month-end budget.

## What Agent ROI Solves

- It connects AI spend to task windows instead of only showing raw usage.
- It helps you review whether expensive work actually produced commits, file changes, or code movement.
- It turns recent task history into insights, waste checks, recommendations, and ranked task lists.

## Current Limits

Current version:

- Codex historical attribution supported
- Claude latest snapshot supported
- Claude historical attribution NOT supported
- Local-first
- No cloud
- No telemetry
- No account required

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Run directly:

```bash
node dist/index.js --help
```

Or link it as a CLI:

```bash
npm link
agent-roi --help
```

## Task Attribution

Task attribution is time-window based.

That means Agent ROI uses:

- project path matching
- task start / stop windows
- Codex session attribution

It does not use:

- prompt intent inference
- diff semantics
- Claude historical reconstruction

See [docs/attribution.md](docs/attribution.md) for the full model.

## Compare

`agent-roi compare` helps answer:

`Am I getting better or worse?`

It compares the last 7 days with the 7 days before that.

Default scope:

- Current Period: Last 7 Days
- Previous Period: Previous 7 Days
- completed tasks only
- Codex task attribution only
- Claude snapshots excluded

Interpretation:

- compare is a trend signal, not a definitive ROI judgment
- local-only
- no cloud
- no telemetry

See [docs/compare.md](docs/compare.md) for the full comparison behavior.

## Watch Mode

`agent-roi watch` is a foreground watch mode, not a daemon.

It works by polling the current Git branch every 15 seconds and mapping branch changes to task start / stop events.

What it does:

- automatically starts a task from the current branch name
- automatically stops the previous task when the branch changes
- stops the current task on `Ctrl+C`

What it does not do:

- no background service
- no system hook
- no prompt listening
- no Claude or Codex conversation reading
- no uploads
- local-only

Limits:

- requires a Git repository
- does not support Detached HEAD

See [docs/watch.md](docs/watch.md) for the full watch mode behavior.
